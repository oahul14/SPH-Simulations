It updates the particles in the `particle_list` for each time-step and writes the updated particles object in a pickle file. \n",

    "Because the given data volume is so huge to save, in order to load it of high efficiency, we output the data in the `.vtp` files instead of traditional csv. This method has the advantage of convenience -- it can serialize arbitrary object with no extra work., and works on a pretty broad range of Python types. It is also smart in that it will only write out any single object once, making it effective to store complex structures because it will write the pickled object in a more efficient binary format, instead of the human-readable format.\n",
    "The user will get the .pkl format files in the directory. The file saves the output data used for subsequent post-processing and for animation according to the user set simulation time output interval n, which is the parameter defined in the function of simulation. When the simulation function generates the new data, it will be dumped into the file immediately. So even if the function breaks down for some reasons in the midway, we can still obtain the data, which to some extent, improves the sustainability of our software."

The algorithm is very inefficient and has a cost complexity of $ O (N ^ 2) $. In order to implement a more efficient algorithm, we have learned that the contribution of the acceleration of particle i from neighbor j is completely opposite in direction, but the size of neighbor j is the same. The contribution of each particle to the density term is the same for i and j.\n",

    "Using this knowledge we can implement an algorithm where we only ever have to calculate the relationship between two nearby particles once. To do this we only search for neighbouring particles in a particular stencil (see image below), and for every iteration add the force contribution to both the particles and the neighbour. After the whole loop every particle will have aggregated the force contributions from every near neighbour.\n",
